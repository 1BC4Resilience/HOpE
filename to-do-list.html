New features to potentially add:
   1) intro for users (maybe like pull down section at the top of Dynamics 365)
   2) add status of projects (and show in description, like project, or maintain as another attribute?)
   3) translation into multiple languages
   4) enable sharing by social media (e.g. as cards on Twitter)
   5) enable people to share search terms (e.g. through URL parameters)
