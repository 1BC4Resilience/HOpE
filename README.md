>The Humanitarian Opportunity Explorer enables people to share an Opportunity (tool, approach, or other resource) with the wide set of colleagues in the Red Cross Red Crescent and with other humanitarian and development partners.
>
>You can see a running version of the site at [1bc4resilience.github.io/HOpE](https://1bc4resilience.github.io/HOpE/).

1. **Project team:**
   > The Humanitarian Opportunity Explorer has been built as part of the collaboration on **Digital and Data Transformation** being under taken by the network of the **International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies** ([IFRC](http://www.ifrc.org)).
   >
   > The explorer builds on:
   >   + an initial suggestion from the British Red Cross 
   >   + a design session held with the Norwegian Red Cross, British Red Cross, and DNV GL, a corporate partner to the Norwegian Red Cross 
   >   + inspiration from a similar [Global Opportunity Explorer](https://goexplorer.org) built by DNV GL and other corporate partners

1. **Features:**
   + provides taster menu to highlight different opportunities and then steers users off to relevant sites for more information
   + content is user generated and collected via Google form
   + responsive site that works well on mobile

1. **Base:**
   + The project builds substantially on [Shuffle.js](https://vestride.github.io/Shuffle).
   + There is also a little bit of html & css from Microsoft Dynamics 365 used for the hidden Intro section.

1. **New features to potentially add:**
   1. fix minor bug so that the search still works when filters are selected
   1. add status of projects (and show in description, like project, or maintain as another attribute?)
   1. translation into multiple languages
   1. enable sharing by social media (e.g. as cards on Twitter)
   1. enable people to share search terms (e.g. through URL parameters)
