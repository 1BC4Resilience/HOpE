#Humanitarian Opportunity Explorer (HOpE)
>
The Humanitarian Opportunity Explorer enables you to share an Opportunity (tool, approach, or other resource) with the wide set of colleagues in the Red Cross Red Crescent and with other humanitarian and development partners.
>
Features:
provides taster menu to highlight different opportunities and then steers users off to relevant sites for follow-up
user generated

Base:
shuttle.js
little bit of html & css from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for hidden Intro section

New features to potentially add:
   1) intro for users (maybe like pull down section at the top of Dynamics 365)
   2) add status of projects (and show in description, like project, or maintain as another attribute?)
   3) translation into multiple languages
   4) enable sharing by social media (e.g. as cards on Twitter)
   5) enable people to share search terms (e.g. through URL parameters)
